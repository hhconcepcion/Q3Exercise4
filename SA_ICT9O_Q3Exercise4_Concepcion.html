	<h3>What is Elyu and Why do I love it?</h3>
    <br>
	<p>La Union, often known as "Elyu" among most millenials, is one of the most popular summer getaways and beach locations of all time. It is also recognized as the Northern Philippines' Surfing Capital. Many people visit since it is one of the closest beaches to Manila. I have been in Elyu thrice already but until now I can't get enough of it and I still want to go there again soon. I like how Elyu is such an accessible beach destination that is also entertaining to visit and offers affordable hotels, which I believe is the most important factor for vacationers. This place is a 10 out of 10 for me especially since I love surfing and swimming. Believe me when I tell that once you visit Elyu, you will want to return. </p>

	<h3>Things you can do here in Elyu</h3>
	<p>Surf, Explore the food scene, Go grape picking at Gapuz Grapes Farm, Witness a sea of clouds at Mt. Puraw, Cliff dive at Tangadan falls, Go ghost hunting at Pindangan Ruins and see amazing art pieces at Kamay Na Bato Art Gallery.</p>
